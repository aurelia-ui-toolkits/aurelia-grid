27 August. 2017

Its not dead :smile:
Been working on new version of my grid, it have its own repo atm at my original repo where I started. 
* Exprimental repo is here [https://github.com/vegarringdal/vGrid](https://github.com/vegarringdal/vGrid)
* Also own book on what added/changed(need a lot of work) here: [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/vegarringdal/dev-rebuild/details)

Please contact me in gitter channel if you want to try the new one. 

Im doing a lot of breaking changes, so just be aware of this if you are considering using it. 
When I have something very stable I can call version 1.0 I will move it over here and retire/own branch for the exsisting grid.

Reasons for rebuild:
* wanted grouping
* wanted locked columns
* some parts was to messy, and Ive learned some new tricks I wanted to use/try (still learing)
